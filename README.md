# react-mongo-express
This is a complicated react frontend example interacting with node backend using mongo.

MongoDB is very lighter and faster than other dbs.
This is the reason why I choosed this one for my project.

And as you know, React is top front end framework and my best expertise.
Very easy to use.

Have a look and make some changes to build awesome full stack web projects.
